  abstract = {Pike-perch (Sander lucioperca L. 1758) is one of the freshwater species caught by professional fishermen in the Netherlands. The species is also popular with sport fishermen. Little is known about its migration and rehabilitation in large river systems. The aim of the present study was to obtain data on the movements of pike-perch in the Dutch large river systems and investigate when and how far individual fish swim up- or downstream. Seasonal migration was expected. The second objective was to gain information on how many fish pass the Haringvlietdam when migrating downstream during high discharge, and ending up in the North Sea. The third objective was to gain data on how many fish were caught by the fishermen. NEDAP TRAIL System{\textregistered} transponders were surgically implanted in 286 pike-perch between June 2007 and October 2008. Marked fish could be detected via several detection stations in the river systems throughout the Netherlands and one in the River Rhine station in Germany. Sport fishermen were asked to inform the organization when a marked fish was caught. Data collected between June 2007 and April 2010 indicate a pike-perch home range of 30--40 km, with some individuals migrating up to more than 200 km. A regional approach regarding fisheries management is necessary. No seasonal patterns were found. Swimming activity was highest during darkness. Results showed pike-perch around the Haringvlietdam swimming in the saltwater area on the sea side of the dam, and returning to the freshwater Lake Haringvliet, indicating that the structure of the dam is used for feeding, but also that the fish will die if the dam is closed when fish are still outside.},

  abstract = {Many invasive species are too widespread to realistically eradicate. For such species, a viable management strategy is to slow the rate of spread. However, to be effective, this will require detailed spread data and an understanding of the influence of environmental conditions and landscape structure on invasion rates. We used a time series of remotely sensed distribution maps and a spatial simulation model to study spread of the invasive Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. L. latifolium is a noxious weed and exhibited rapid, explosive spread. Annual infested area and empirical dispersal kernels were derived from the remotely sensed distributions in order to assess the influence of weather conditions on spread and to parameterize the simulation model. Spread rates and dispersal distances were highest for nascent infestations and in years with wet springs. Simulations revealed that spread rates were more strongly influenced by the length of long-distance dispersal than by temporal variation in its likelihood. It is thus important to capture long-distance dispersal and the conditions that facilitate spread when collecting data to parameterize spread models. Additionally, management actions performed in high-spread years, targeting long-distance recruits, can effectively contain infestations. Corridors were relatively unimportant to spread rates; their effectiveness at enhancing rate of spread was limited by the species' dispersal ability and the time needed to travel through the corridor. In contrast, habitat abundance and shape surrounding the introduction site strongly influenced invasion dynamics. Satellite patches invading large areas of invasible habitat present especially high risk.},

  abstract = {Rivers support some of Earth's richest biodiversity1 and provide essential ecosystem services to society2, but they are often fragmented by barriers to free flow3. In Europe, attempts to quantify river connectivity have been hampered by the absence of a harmonized barrier database. Here we show that there are at least 1.2 million instream barriers in 36 European countries (with a mean density of 0.74 barriers per kilometre), 68 per cent of which are structures less than two metres in height that are often overlooked. Standardized walkover surveys along 2,715 kilometres of stream length for 147 rivers indicate that existing records underestimate barrier numbers by about 61 per cent. The highest barrier densities occur in the heavily modified rivers of central Europe and the lowest barrier densities occur in the most remote, sparsely populated alpine areas. Across Europe, the main predictors of barrier density are agricultural pressure, density of river-road crossings, extent of surface water and elevation. Relatively unfragmented rivers are still found in the Balkans, the Baltic states and parts of Scandinavia and southern Europe, but these require urgent protection from proposed dam developments. Our findings could inform the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which aims to reconnect 25,000 kilometres of Europe's rivers by 2030, but achieving this will require a paradigm shift in river restoration that recognizes the widespread impacts caused by small barriers.},

The initial module prioritises the introduced fishes in the risk assessment area according to their potential invasiveness and current distribution. The second module then assesses populations of the prioritised species in relation to the character of their receiving waters and the potential risks posed by their population in that circumstance; the output is a suggested management action for each population. The third module evaluates the suggested management action in relation to its potential impacts in the environment and how these impacts may be mitigated. The final module assesses the estimated cumulative cost of the selected management action relative to an alternative action. To demonstrate its potential value for managing extant populations of introduced fish, three eradication case-studies from England were assessed retrospectively using the scheme. This revealed eradication of two topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva populations was commensurate with their levels of ecological risk in the environment. By contrast, initial assessment of the eradication of a feral population of fathead minnow Pimephales promelas suggested control and containment was the commensurate management action due to a relatively low risk of natural dispersal. Application of the scheme elsewhere in the world and to other faunal groups should enable more objective decision-making in management programmes and enhance conservation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Non-native fishes are frequently used to enhance aquaculture and fisheries; if introduced into the wider environment, then the majority will have negligible effects on native biodiversity. However, a minority will become invasive, causing adverse ecological effects, and so management actions may be needed to minimize their dispersal and impacts. These actions include eradication attempts from specific waters or well-defined spatial areas, population control by suppression (e.g. through removal programmes) and containment of existing populations to prevent their further spread. These remedial actions have generally only been undertaken across large spatial areas in developed countries; experience suggests a fundamental constraint is a lack of selective removal methods that target the non-native fish species only. For example, eradication methods tend to be limited to low technology, `scorched-earth' techniques (e.g. biocide chemicals) whose use is generally constrained to relatively small and enclosed water bodies. Risk management of non-native fishes should ensure that actions taken are commensurate with the level of risk posed by that species in the environment; although pre-introduction risk assessment schemes have been developed, there remains a lack of decision support tools for post-introduction situations. Although this inhibits the management of non-native fishes in the environment, control programmes such as those against common carp Cyprinus carpio in Australia and topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva in England and Wales suggest there is potential for invasions to be managed and controlled within large spatial areas, even if their eradication may not be feasible.},

  abstract = {The Emergency Recovery Plan for freshwater biodiversity recognizes that addressing nonnative species is one of six principal actions needed to bend the curve in freshwater biodiversity loss. This is because introduction rates of nonnative species continue to accelerate globally and where these species develop invasive populations, they can have severe impacts on freshwater biodiversity. The most effective management measure to protect freshwater biodiversity is to prevent introductions of nonnative species. Should a nonnative species be introduced, however, then its early detection and the implementation of rapid reaction measures can avoid it establishing and dispersing. If these measures are unsuccessful and the species becomes invasive, then control and containment measures can minimize its further spread and impact. Minimizing further spread and impact includes control methods to reduce invader abundance and containment methods such as screening of invaded sites and strict biosecurity to avoid the invader dispersing to neighbouring basins. These management actions have benefitted from developments in invasion risk assessment that can prioritize species according to their invasion risk and, for species already invasive, ensure that management actions are commensurate with assessed risk. The successful management of freshwater nonnative species still requires the overcoming of some implementation challenges, including nonnative species often being a symptom of degraded habitats rather than the main driver of ecological change, and eradication methods often being nonspecies specific. Given the multiple anthropogenic stressors in freshwaters, nonnative species management must work with other restoration strategies if it is to deliver the Emergency Recovery Plan for freshwater biodiversity.},

  abstract = {In Europe, the non-indigenous species (NIS) most frequently introduced are freshwater fish (Garc{\'i}a-Berthou et al. 2005). Once introduced, dispersal is a key element in determining their invasiveness (Rehage and Sih 2004); in order to limit or mitigate impacts, an understanding of likely establishment and rates and routes for dispersion is important (Pihlaja et al. 1998, Ricciardi and Rasmussen 1998). Currently, however, we have limited information on the potential for range expansion for most of the non-indigenous freshwater fish species introduced into Europe. Dispersal is likely to be at least partially dependent on the tolerance of these species to variable environmental conditions, but tolerances are often poorly understood, particularly in the new environment. The possibility of using shared estuaries as `saline bridges' to migrate between contiguous freshwater systems has only very rarely been considered (Brown et al. 2001, Bringolf et al. 2005), and it has usually been assumed that estuaries will act as barriers (rather than bridges) to the dispersal of freshwater fish. However, the salinity tolerances and physiological responses to salinity are poorly understood in many NIS. This lack of knowledge may lead to their inaccurate classification as strictly freshwater, whereas some species may be at least partially euryhaline and capable of living in a wider range of salinities than previously considered.},

However, previous studies have focused on the dispersal of invasive species through continuous habitats, despite the high levels of anthropogenic fragmentation in modern environments. This study investigated how personality influences the behaviour of aquatic invasive species at an anthropogenic barrier to dispersal, using the passage behaviour of American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, at an experimental Crump weir as a model system. Personality was characterized by determining the repeatability of boldness, activity and sociability, with correlations between traits indicating behavioural syndromes, while passage behaviour was quantified as motivation and subsequent ability to pass the weir. Boldness and activity were repeatable and positively correlated, indicating a boldness--activity syndrome. However, sociability was not repeatable and was therefore not classified as a personality trait, potentially as a result of the confounding effects of social hierarchy formation. Bolder individuals tended to be more motivated to pass the weir, although motivation was not related to activity. Few individuals passed the weir, and personality was not related to passage success. This study evidences the presence of behavioural syndromes in signal crayfish and demonstrates that personality can influence the motivation of invasive species to expand their range in a fragmented habitat. Although no relationship with passage success was observed, the higher levels of motivation in bold individuals may lead to differential passage success in natural situations where the time to attempt passage is not constrained by experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {Aim The relationships between species and their landscape are important for understanding migration patterns. In fluvial systems, the complexity of the river network can strongly influence the dispersal and colonization rates of invading alien fishes, but habitat quality, species' biological traits and their location of introduction are also potentially important. However, understandings of how these factors interact in the wild to influence the spatial distribution of invasive species over time are limited from empirical studies. Location ``Virtual'' and ``real-world'' rivers from England and Wales. Method We developed an individual-based model (IBM) to predict how these different factors influenced the invasion dynamics and population growth rates (as abundances) of nine ``virtual'' alien fishes over two timeframes (10 and 30 years). The alien fishes differed in their demographic (r- to K-selected) and dispersal (fast to slow) characteristics and the rivers in their network complexity. Results Irrespective of river type, species and timeframe, the main drivers of both dispersal and population growth were the location of the introduction and the mean habitat quality of the patch into which the species were released. The introduction location determined whether dispersal was mainly passive in a downstream direction (faster) or active in an upstream direction (slower), with higher habitat quality then enabling faster population growth rates. Over 30 years, invasion rates were predicted to increase as the complexity of the river network increased, as this opened multiple invasion fronts where the invader traits favoured faster dispersal. Main conclusions This novel IBM revealed how the complexity of the physical environment interacts with the biological traits of alien species to influence invasion outcomes, with the location of the introduction and its habitat quality being the most important factors. These results thus substantially increase understanding of the factors that influence the dispersal and colonization rates of alien freshwater fishes.},

  abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action -- `Water for Life' -- 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01\% of the World's water and approximately 0.8\% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million -- almost 6\% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the `Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as `receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and -- in the case of migrating aquatic fauna -- downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management -- one that has been appropriately termed `reconciliation ecology'.},

This essay explains why freshwater ecosystems are global hotspots of biological richness, despite a panoply of interacting threats that jeopardize biodiversity. The combined effects of these threats will soon become detrimental to humans since provision of ecosystem services, such as protein from capture fisheries, can only be sustained if waters remain healthy. Climate change poses an insidious existential threat to freshwater biodiversity in the Anthropocene, but immediate risks from dams, habitat degradation and pollution could well be far greater.},

Most of the introductions took place after 1900, with a significant exponential increase during the second half of the 20th century (15 species introduced from 1949). Major stocking efforts in Spanish waters have been suspended, but recently some species have been released by anglers or are suspected to be escapes from fish farms. Stream regulation is considered to be one of the main negative factors affecting river ecosystems in Spain, but many of the aliens adapt well to these altered habitats. Competition between native and exotic fishes is certain to occur to some degree, but there is little quantitative information. Fish conservation and fishery management must not be based on the `introduce anything' sentiment that has developed over more than a century. Information, education and public awareness are critical components of any effort to prevent the spread of introduced fish species.},

Pikeperch is a non-native fish introduced to Iberian freshwater fauna in 1998 that quickly spread to other river basins through human-mediated activities, occupying now a wide variety of habitats along mainland Portugal. Condition (K and SMI), fork length at age, and length--weight relationships were studied for Portuguese populations. Pikeperch fork length for ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 was different between several populations. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to study the influence of habitat type, latitude, altitude, time after first detection, and fish prey richness on pikeperch populations size at age 4 and condition. We observed higher condition values on populations from lower altitudes at lentic systems more recently introduced. But higher fork length at age 4 was found in populations from higher altitudes, on older populations with higher prey richness. Habitat type, time since first detection, and fish fauna composition are discussed as the main environmental factors explaining the observed phenotypic plasticity with concerns on predatory impact on native fauna.},

  abstract = {This review provides a contemporary account of knowledge on aspects of introductions of non-native fish species and includes issues associated with introduction pathways, ecological and economic impacts, risk assessments, management options and impact of climate change. It offers guidance to reconcile the increasing demands of certain stakeholders to diversify their activities using non-native fishes with the long-term sustainability of native aquatic biodiversity. The rate at which non-native freshwater fishes have been introduced worldwide has doubled in the space of 30 years, with the principal motives being aquaculture (39\%) and improvement of wild stocks (17\%). Economic activity is the principal driver of human-mediated non-native fish introductions, including the globalization of fish culture, whereby the production of the African cichlid tilapia is seven times higher in Asia than in most areas of Africa, and Chile is responsible for c. 30\% of the world's farmed salmon, all based on introduced species. Consequently, these economic benefits need balancing against the detrimental environmental, social and economic effects of introduced non-native fishes. There are several major ecological effects associated with non-native fish introductions, including predation, habitat degradation, increased competition for resources, hybridization and disease transmission. Consideration of these aspects in isolation, however, is rarely sufficient to adequately characterize the overall ecological effect of an introduced species. Regarding the management of introduced non-native fish, pre-introduction screening tools, such as the fish invasiveness scoring kit (FISK), can be used to ensure that species are not introduced, which may develop invasive populations. Following the introduction of non-native fish that do develop invasive populations, management responses are typified by either a remediation or a mitigation response, although these are often difficult and expensive to implement, and may have limited effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Free-flowing rivers (FFRs) support diverse, complex and dynamic ecosystems globally, providing important societal and economic services. Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

  abstract = {The increase in popularity of `big game' type angling in the UK has lead to a proliferation of waters stocked with non-native species. Many introductions have been illegal and the potentially irreversible ecological consequences are yet to be realised. Some case histories are presented and show the potential impacts of these species to involve the effects of predation, competition, disease, hybridisation and habitat degradation. Responding to anglers' demands while controlling any illegal spread of non-native fish in the wild is a major challenge. The legislation that governs the movement of fish into and within England and Wales is shared between the Environment Agency and other Government organisations, a situation that engenders significant management difficulties and enables less scrupulous movers of fish to exploit any weaknesses in the enforcement system. The problem is being addressed in a number of ways. A fully coordinated approach to the regulation of fish movements is being facilitated by a new database and the Environment Agency has reviewed the policies through which it regulates movements of fish into the wild. The guiding principle is that fish introductions should not jeopardise the well being of naturally established ecosystems, i.e. there should be no detriment to the donor or recipient fisheries, or to the fish being introduced. This approach was endorsed by a recent Government review of fisheries legislation that recommended strengthening controls over inappropriate movements of fish.},

  abstract = {Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are one of the principal threats to freshwater biodiversity. Exclusion barriers are increasingly being used as a management strategy to control the spread of AIS. However, exclusion barriers can also impact native organisms and their effectiveness is likely to be context dependent. We conducted a quantitative literature review to evaluate the use of barriers to control animal AIS in freshwater ecosystems worldwide. The quantitative aspect of the review was supplemented by case studies that describe some of the challenges, successes, and opportunities for the use of the use of AIS exclusion barriers globally. Barriers have been used since the 1950s to control the spread of AIS, but effort has been increasing since 2005 (80\% of studies) and an increasingly diverse range of AIS taxa are now targeted in a wide range of habitat types. The global use of AIS barriers has been concentrated in North America (74\% of studies), Australasia (11\%), and Europe (10\%). Physical barriers (e.g., weirs, exclusion screens, and velocity barriers) have been most widely used (47\%), followed by electric (27\%) and chemical barriers (12\%). Fish were the most targeted taxa (86\%), followed by crustaceans (10\%), molluscs (3\%) and amphibians (1\%). Most studies have been moderately successful in limiting the passage of AIS, with 86\% of the barriers tested deterring {$>$}70\% of individuals. However, only 25\% of studies evaluated barrier impacts on native species, and development of selective passage is still in its infancy. Most studies have been too short (47\% {$<$} 1 year, 87\% {$<$} 5 years) to detect ecological impacts or have failed to use robust before-after-control-impact (BACI) study designs (only 5\%). Hence, more effective monitoring is required to assess the long-term effectiveness of exclusion barriers as an AIS management tool. Our global case studies highlight the pressing need for AIS control in many ecoregions, and exclusion barriers have the potential to become an effective tool in some situations. However, the design and operation of exclusion barriers must be refined to deliver selective passage of native fauna, and exclusion barriers should only be used sparingly as part of a wider integrated management strategy.}

Eight of 13 tagged fish in the lower reaches of the river were located throughout the whole study. Five of these fish moved upstream to various sites in the river prior to spawning, which occurred from late April to June. The three remaining fish moved to the fjord. These movements were interpreted as a spawning migration, and it is suggested that the lower reaches of the River Gudenaa constitute an over-wintering area for pikeperch, which use different spawning areas. Ten pikeperch caught just downstream of an impassable hydropower plant were radio-tagged and translocated upstream of the dam to a reservoir. Within a week, half of the fish moved to a lake situated more than 30 km upstream the reservoir. This behaviour is hypothesised to be a homing response. The study reveals that the pikeperch is a highly mobile species with a complicated migration pattern, even in relatively small river systems.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation of freshwater biodiversity requires spatially explicit investigations of how dams and hydroclimatic alterations among climate regions may interact to drive species to extinction. We investigated how dams and hydroclimatic alterations interact with species ecological and life history traits to influence past extirpation probabilities of native freshwater fishes in the Upper and Lower Colorado River (CR), Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT), and Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) basins. Using long-term discharge data for continuously gaged streams and rivers, we quantified streamflow anomalies (i.e., departure ``expected'' streamflow) at the sub-basin scale over the past half-century. Next, we related extirpation probabilities of native fishes in both regions to streamflow anomalies, river basin characteristics, species traits, and non-native species richness using binomial logistic regression. Sub-basin extirpations in the Southwest (n = 95 Upper CR, n = 130 Lower CR) were highest in lowland mainstem rivers impacted by large dams and in desert springs. Dampened flow seasonality, increased longevity (i.e., delayed reproduction), and decreased fish egg sizes (i.e., lower parental care) were related to elevated fish extirpation probability in the Southwest. Sub-basin extirpations in the Southeast (ACT n = 46, ACF n = 22) were most prevalent in upland rivers, with flow dependency, greater age and length at maturity, isolation by dams, and greater distance upstream. Our results confirm that dams are an overriding driver of native fish species losses, irrespective of basin-wide differences in native or non-native species richness. Dams and hydrologic alterations interact with species traits to influence community disassembly, and very high extirpation risks in the Southeast are due to interactions between high dam density and species restricted ranges. Given global surges in dam building and retrofitting, increased extirpation risks should be expected unless management strategies that balance flow regulation with ecological outcomes are widely implemented.},

The present study describes the trophic ecology of the introduced pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) in two southwestern French rivers, using stable isotope analysis. Pikeperch could be categorized as a top-predator, and had a significantly higher trophic position (TP, mean{\textpm}SE=4.2{\textpm}0.1) compared to other predatory fish such as the native pike (Esox lucius, TP=3.7{\textpm}0.1) and the introduced European catfish (Silurus glanis, TP=3.8{\textpm}0.1). Most studies of resource use in freshwaters consider predatory fish as ecologically equivalent; however, this study showed that the pikeperch occupied a higher trophic niche compared to other predatory species in the Lot and Tarn rivers (Garonne River basin). This apparent specialization may thus have consequences upon interspecific relationships within the predatory guild and upon the functional organization of biological communities.

  abstract = {The round goby Neogobius melanostomus is one of the most wide-ranging invasive fish on earth, with substantial introduced populations within the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed, the Baltic Sea and several major European rivers. Rapid expansion and deleterious ecosystem effects have motivated extensive research on this species; here this research is synthesized. Maps of the global distribution are provided and the invasion history of N. melanostomus, which spread more rapidly at first in North America, but has undergone substantial expansion over the past decade in the Baltic Sea, is summarized. Meta-analyses comparing their size at age, diet, competitors and predators in North American and European ecosystems are provided. Size at age is region specific, with saline habitats typically supporting larger and faster growing individuals than fresh water. Neogobius melanostomus prey differs substantially between regions, demonstrating a capacity to adapt to locally abundant food sources. Neogobius melanostomus comprise at least 50\% of the diet of eight taxa in at least one site or life stage; in total, 16 predator taxa are documented from the Laurentian Great Lakes v. five from Eurasia. Invasive N. melanostomus are the only common forage fish to heavily exploit mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, facilitating the transfer of energy from mussels to higher trophic levels in both systems. Neogobius melanostomus morphology, life history, reproduction, habitat preferences, environmental tolerances, parasites, environmental effects, sampling strategies and management are also discussed. Neogobius melanostomus inhabit a wide range of temperate freshwater and brackish-water ecosystems and will probably continue to spread via ballast water, accidental bait release and natural dispersal worldwide. Climate change will probably enhance N. melanostomus expansion by elevating water temperatures closer to its energetic optimum of 26{$^\circ$} C. Future research needs are presented; most pressing are evaluating the economic effects of N. melanostomus invasion, determining long-term population level effects of egg predation on game-fish recruitment and comparing several variables (density, ecological effects morphology and life history) among invaded ecosystems. This review provides a central reference as researchers continue studying N. melanostomus, often as examples for advancing basic ecology and invasion biology.},

These gradients include both abiotic (e.g. salinity and temperature) and biotic parameters (e.g. prey and predator abundances). The Baltic Sea thus forms a variable, and with respect to salinity, extreme, environment for a typical limnetic and warm water species like pikeperch. It is forced to spawn in shallow inlets, estuaries and bays where salinity is lower and temperature higher than in exposed areas. Pikeperch occur mainly in eutrophicated archipelagoes and bays where the spring and summer temperatures are high. It has expanded its distribution in recent decades, in response to increased coastal eutrophication. Pikeperch is also favoured by high summer temperatures, as shown by a positive correlation between temperature and year-class strength. Pikeperch populations are heavily affected by human disturbances and exploitation. In many areas it is economically the most important species. The effects of intensive fishery on pikeperch populations are largely unknown, as is the ecological significance of pikeperch as a piscivorous predator.},

In the Curonian Lagoon water temperature is generally higher than in the coastal waters. Field studies of growth and condition characteristics of pikeperch and perch were carried out in these water bodies with the aim to estimate growth differences of the two fish species under different salinity and temperature conditions. Additionally, an experimental study of the impact of salinity on the growth of perch young-of-the-year (YOY) was performed to test the hypothesis that a brackish environment positively influences percids. Field observations revealed that body length, condition factor, fatness coefficient and fat content in muscles were significantly higher in individuals inhabiting the cooler, brackish waters of the Baltic Sea than in individuals inhabiting the Curonian Lagoon. A positive effect of low salinity on growth was also established in the experimental study. Hence, the study results suggest that under certain temperature conditions, brackish waters beneficially affect the growth of pikeperch and perch.},

These changes have resulted in the global extinction of three taxa and the extirpation of 18 species lowering the number of currently extant native species in the Great Lakes basin from 169 to 148 species. A further 82 species have declined to the point of endangerment in at least one jurisdiction in the basin. The causes of these declines are primarily habitat alterations, aquatic invasive species, and overexploitation. Some significant changes in the fish fauna of the Great Lakes basin have also been the result of the successful introduction and establishment of 35 non-native species. In addition, 34 non-native species have been found in the basin, but have not, or are not thought to have, established reproducing populations. These species have been introduced through a variety of pathways including commercial shipping, dispersal, live trade, recreational boating and angling, and stocking. Many of these species have substantially impacted the Great Lakes ecosystem directly through predation and competition or indirectly through trophic disruption and disease transmission. The relative importance of pathways as a source of new introductions has changed over time, and can be expected to continue to change as a result of evolving regulations and trade patterns. The fish fauna of the Great Lakes basin will continue to change as the result of continuing threats to native species and ongoing introductions of non-native species, and such change will undoubtedly be influenced by climate change and human population growth.},

Animals and plants manage to persist in riverine ecosystems, though, which in fact harbour high biological diversity. Here, we study metapopulation persistence in river networks analysing stage-structured populations that exploit different dispersal pathways, both along-stream and overland. Using stability analysis, we derive a novel criterion for metapopulation persistence in arbitrarily complex landscapes described as spatial networks. We show how dendritic geometry and overland dispersal can promote population persistence, and that their synergism provides an explanation of the so-called `drift paradox'. We also study the geography of the initial spread of a species and place it in the context of biological invasions. Applications concerning the persistence of stream salamanders in the Shenandoah river, and the spread of two invasive species in the Mississippi-Missouri are also discussed.},

Spatially derived physical parameter estimates and literature based fish capabilities and tolerances were used to predict fish passage success and habitat suitability. Both the fish passage and the habitat suitability models accurately predicted fish presence above barriers for most common, non-stocked species. The fish passage model predicted that barriers greater than or equal to 6m block all migratory species. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was expected to be blocked the least. The habitat suitability model predicted that low gradient streams with intact habitat quality were likely to support the highest number of fish species. The fish passage and habitat suitability models were intended to be used by environmental managers as strategy development tools to prioritize candidate dams for field assessment and make decisions regarding the management of migratory fish populations.},

Interviews with sport anglers (n =~12) targeting native pike (Esox lucius) and invasive pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) in the River Severn, Western England, were conducted to determine angler motivations, behaviors, and perceptions. Although motivations were catch orientated, they also related to catching wild fish in natural surroundings. Conservation values were reflected in the behavioral safeguarding of pikeperch populations, including catch-and-release practices that are contrary to current fisheries policy. Anglers perceived pikeperch as enhancing the fishery without causing long-term ecological impacts and were opposed to current management practices and policy. These results suggest considerable disjuncture between angler motivations and behaviors, and non-native fish policy and management.},

  abstract = {Introduced fishes can develop invasive populations that impact native species and ecosystems. Understanding the population ecology of introduced species in their extended ranges and how this compares to their native ranges is therefore important for informing their management. Here, the age and somatic growth rates of the piscivorous freshwater fish pikeperch Sander lucioperca were analysed across their invasive and native ranges to determine their spatial patterns and drivers. Analyses were initially completed in their invaded range in central and western England. Populations varied spatially in their growth rates; being slowest for a population in a narrow and shallow canal and fastest in a large, impounded lowland river. A meta-analysis of parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth model then revealed that across their native and invasive ranges, their theoretical ultimate lengths (L{$\infty$}) and growth coefficients (K) were significantly related to latitude, but not longitude. Their relationships with latitude were nonlinear, with higher values of L{$\infty$} and lower values of K being evident towards their northerly and southerly range limits. Faster growth rates were evident in the middle of their range (45 to 55{$^\circ$}N), suggesting temperatures here were most optimal for growth, but were in a trade-off with reduced ultimate lengths. These spatial patterns suggest that whilst introduced S. lucioperca can colonise new waters across a wide area, the expression of their life-history traits will vary spatially, with potential implications for how invasive populations establish and integrate into native fish communities.},

  abstract = {Species invasions often occur on coasts and estuaries where abiotic conditions vary, e.g. salinity, temperature, runoff etc. Successful establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous species in many such systems are poorly understood, partially since the species tend to show genetic and ecological plasticity at population level towards many abiotic conditions, including salinity tolerance. Plasticity may be driven by shifting expression of heat shock proteins such as Hsp70, which is widely recognized as indicator of physical stress. In this study, we developed a qPCR assay for expression of the hsp70 gene in the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and tested the expression response of fish collected from a brackish environment in the western Baltic Sea to three different salinities, 0, 10 and 30. hsp70 expression was highest in fresh water, indicating higher stress, and lower at brackish (ambient condition for the sampled population) and oceanic salinities, suggestive of low stress response to salinities above the population's current distribution. The highest stress in fresh water was surprising since populations in fresh water exist, e.g. large European rivers and Laurentian Great Lakes. The results have implications to predictions for the species' plasticity potential and possible range expansion of the species into other salinity regimes.},

  abstract = {Invasive species, and the ensuing homogenization of the world's biota, form a global problem with consequences ranging from the decline and extirpation of native species to threats to human health. The magnitude of this issue demands a thorough understanding of the invasion process, which consists of three main stages: initial dispersal, establishment of self-sustaining populations, and spread. To assess the relative distribution of research effort among these stages, we conducted a literature review using 873 articles published in 23 major journals over the past 10 years. Of the 873 papers, only 96 (11.0\%) studied initial dispersal, and only half of these (6.2\% of the total) were empirical. As the first stage in a contingent process, we argue that initial dispersal is the best stage during which to direct management efforts. In addition, initial dispersal has direct relevance for fundamental ecological questions regarding community assembly and metacommunity dynamics. In so far that answering these questions and preventing invasion are goals of ecologists, the disparity in research effort noted here suggests that ecologists need to expand their efforts to include more research on initial dispersal.},

  abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

  abstract = {The effect of ambient salinity changes (0.9, 6 and 12 psu) on the levels of dissolved ammonia (DA), ninhydrin positive substances (NPS), trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) in the blood and tissue of medium-acclimated Sander lucioperca L. (also Stizostedion lucioperca) were investigated. In freshwater, blood and tissue total free amino acid levels (measured as NPS) were 3.62 mM and 60.61 mM, respectively. The NPS content increased significantly (P{$<$}0.05) in the tissue and blood on acclimation to 6 and 12 psu salinities. The mass-specific tissue TMAO concentration of pikeperch acclimated to normal freshwater was 0.413{\textpm}0.084 {$\mu$}mol TMAO g-1. Results reveal that TMAO levels are positively influenced by the external salinity medium where significant differences in mean levels occurred between the groups (P{$<$}0.05). The calculated p[NH3] and [NH4+] gradients reveal that the [NH3] gradient was consistently low (cf. the [NH4+] gradient). The gradient of p[NH3] decreased with the medium increased salinities. The results suggest that freshwater pikeperch may be able to resist salinity changes by manipulation of nitrogen metabolism. Free amino acids and TMAO are involved in mediating response to salinity exposure in freshwater pikeperch.},

  abstract = {-- To address the dearth of information on tagging effects and long-term survivorship of tagged fish in native and introduced species, laboratory and field investigations were undertaken on three non-native fish species (pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus; topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva; pikeperch Sander lucioperca) tagged with coded-wire (CW), passive integrated transponder (PIT), radio (RT) telemetry and/or acoustic tags (AT), with survivorship of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) examined in the field. Laboratory results revealed high survivorship following tag attachment/insertion and resumption of feeding within 24--48 h of tagging (all mortalities could be attributed to an unrelated outbreak of fungal infection), with retention rates being high in both pumpkinseed and pikeperch but low in topmouth gudgeon (excluded from field studies). In the field, short-term post-operation survival was high in pikeperch, pumpkinseed and brown trout. In pumpkinseed and trout, 100\% of RT fish survived a 24--30 day tracking study, with 60\% and 80\%, respectively, recaptured alive at least 3 months post-tagging. Of PIT tagged pumpkinseed, 44\% were recaptured (after 6--18 months), with small-sized, CW-tagged fish (0.38 g weight) captured up to 1 year after tagging. In pikeperch, all AT fish except one (the smallest specimen) survived their full expected tracking period (i.e. tag life) -- the single lost specimen survived at least half of its expected tracking period (i.e. 6 month battery life). Overall, the tagging methods used were highly effective in pumpkinseed and pikeperch, showing good retention and survival, but PIT tagging of topmouth gudgeon was plagued by low survivorship and tag rejection.},
